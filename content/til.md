# Rust's story

- **Minimal core:**
    - Ownership and borrowing, traits
    - Zero-cost abstractions
    - No runtime, no garbage collector, not even a concept of threads
- **Extended with libraries:**
    - Fundamentals: vectors, hashmaps, reference-counted pointers
    - Higher-level: Work-stealing runtimes, servers, database links

---

# Rust's story

```rust
fn dot_product(vec1: &[u32], vec2: &[u32]) -> u32 {
  vec1
    .iter()
    .zip(vec2)
    .map(|(a, b)| a * b)
    .sum()
}
```

--

- Compiles to vectorized loop

---

# Rust's story

```rust
fn dot_product(vec1: &[u32], vec: &[u32]) -> u32 {
  vec1
    .par_iter()
    .zip(vec2)
    .map(|(a, b)| a * b)
    .sum()
}
```

--

.line3[![Arrow](content/images/Arrow.png)]

- Vectorized loops across a work-stealing scheduler

---

# Rust's story

```rust
fn dot_product(vec1: &[u32], vec2: &[u32]) -> u32 {
  let mut counter = 0;
  vec1
    .par_iter()
    .zip(vec2)
    .map(|(a, b)| {
       counter += 1; // <-- ERROR
       a * b
    })
    .sum()
}
```

---

# But it wasn't always this way

- Early days:
  - Erlang-like tasks, a runtime, garbage collector
  - Ownership added as a perf optimization
  - Unsound, easy to crash

---

# But it wasn't always this way

- Introduced region types to gain flexibility
  - But retained an ocaml- or C-like mutation model

---

# But it wasn't always this way

- Moved to inherited mutability and "IMHTWAMA"
  - `T` -- owned
  - `&T` -- shared, immutable
  - `&mut T` -- **unique**, mutable

--

.center[.p80[![IMHTWAMA](content/images/imhtwama.png)]]


---

# But it wasn't always this way (part 2)

- Iterated also on a few other axes:
    - generic programming
        - simple generics => classes+interfaces => traits
    - threads and runtime
        - moved into libraries, out from language

---

# What *was* always true

- uncompromised efficiency
- safety and correctness
- CoC and culture emphasizing **curiosity and deep research**

--

**Focused on finding the best answer, not on winning the argument.**

# The research spiral

# The research spiral

The only thing that has ever worked for me:

- Find an area that interests you
    - maybe you don't even have a specific *problem* to solve yet
- Reproduce or apply what exists
- Somewhere along the way, an idea will strike you
    - pursue it
- Repeat ad ~~nauseum~~ infinitum

# Future-compatibility warnings

- Grace period to correct code that should not have been accepted

# TIL: Account for versioning

When we prove a type system to be *sound*, we mean that the program as
written is fine.

---

# TIL: Account for versioning

.center[.p80[![Things have changed](content/images/dylan-changed.gif)]]

???

---

# Semantic versioning ("semver")

- Version 1.0
- Version 1.1 -- adds new features, but 1.0 users still work
- Version 1.1.1 -- just bug fixes, you definitely want this
- Version 2.0 -- 1.x users may require changes

---

# Traits

```rust
trait Hash {
  fn hash(&self) -> u32;
}

struct HashSet<K: Hash> {
  //           ^^^^^^^
}
```

---

# Impls

```rust
struct u32 { .. }

impl Hash for u32 {
  fn hash(&self) -> u32 {
    *self
  }
}
```

---

# "The HashTable problem"

- Initial designs permitted "scoped impls"

```rust
// Scope 1: Hash of u32 is identity
fn create_set() -> HashSet<u32> {
  let mut set = HashSet::new();
  set.insert(22);
  set.insert(44);
  set
}
```

--

```rust
// Scope 2 has some other definition of Hash for u32
fn use_set() {
  let set = create_set();
  set.contains(22) // ???
}
```

---

# Coherence

- At most one impl for any type
- Relatively easy to enforce within one crate: check!
- Across crates:
  - Impl must define *either* the self-type *or* the trait type
  - "Orphan rule" from Haskell

---

# Checking for duplicates

Obvious collision:

```rust
impl Hash for u32 { ... }
impl Hash for u32 { ... }
```

---

# Checking for duplicates

What about this:

```rust
trait AsU32 {
  fn as_u32(&self) - &u32;
}

impl Hash for u32 { ... }
impl<T: AsU32> Hash for T { ... }
//   ^^^^^^^^
```

---

# Checking for duplicates

If this impl exists:

```rust
impl AsU32 for u32 { ... }
```

then these two impls overlap:

```rust
impl Hash for u32 { .. }
impl<T: AsU32> Hash for T { .. }
```

so which should we use?

---

# Checking for duplicates

.center[.p80[![RFC 48](content/images/rfc-48.png)]]

---

# Enter: time and versioning

```rust
// Crate 1, v1.0:
trait AsU32 { }
struct MyType { }

// Crate 2, v1.0:
trait Hash { }
impl<T: AsU32> Hash for T { }
impl Hash for crate1::MyType { }
```

---

# In v1.1, crate 1 adds an impl

```rust
// Crate 1, v1.1:
trait AsU32 { }
struct MyType { }
impl AsU32 for MyType { } // added in 1.1...

// Crate 2, v1.0:
trait Hash { }
impl<T: AsU32> Hash for T { }
impl Hash for crate1::MyType { } // ...now we have a conflict
```

---

# Negative reasoning

```rust
trait Hash { }
impl<T: AsU32> Hash for T { }
impl Hash for crate1::MyType { } // ...now we have a conflict
```

--

- Crate 2 is employing a sort of **negative reasoning** here:
  - no intersection because `not { crate1::MyType: AsU32 }`

--
- These rules make it a **semver breaking change** to add an impl:
  - not ok

---

# Rebalancing

.center[.p80[![RFC 48](content/images/rfc-1023.png)]]

---

# Coherence still a problem

- The rules here continue to bedevil us
- Very tricky balancing act

---

# Another semver related change

```rust
struct Point {
  x: u32,
  y: u32,
}

fn example() {
  let p1 = Point { x: 22, y: 44 };
  let p2 = p1;
  draw(p1);
  draw(p2);
}
```

--

.line8b[![Hi](content/images/Arrow.png)]

--

- In earlier versions of Rust, this would be a copy
    - but then adding `z: Box<u32>` is a breaking change
- Now, it's a move
    - must explicitly `impl Copy for Point`

---

# But auto traits

Rust has a `Send` trait: can something be sent across threads safely?

Most things are `Send`:

```rust
u32
Vec<Element>
HashMap<Key, Value>
```

---

# Reference counting is not `Send`

Reference counting:

```rust
Rc<Vec<Element>>
```

But atomic reference counting is (though it's slower):

```rust
Arc<Vec<Element>>
```

---

# Send is "automatic"

```rust
struct Context {
  data: HashMap<SomeKey, SomeValue>
}
```

Here, we assume that `Context: Send`.

--

So if you changed to `Rc<HashMap<..>>`, that's a semver violation.

--

Considerations

- re-usable libraries tend to eschew `Rc`, preferrering ownership
- we wanted to enable parallelism deeply
- basically a "bet" that this wouldn't be a big deal *in practice*
    - so far, seems to have paid off

---

# More versioning cases

- Exhaustive matching on enums
    - What if people add variants?
- Definite tension:
    - Tight construction
    - Evolving needs
- Ye Olde "Expression Problem"

---

# TIL: Many definitions of "simple"

# Borrow checking initially

  let mut v = vec![1, 2, 3];
  let p = &v; // ----+
  v.push(3);  //     |
} // <---------------+ scope of the borrow
```

---

# Borrow checking now

fn foo() {
  let mut v = vec![1, 2, 3];
  let p = &v; // ----+
  v.push(3);  // <---+

# Three axes

How much information do you need to confidently understand what a
particular line of code is doing, and how hard is that information to
find?

--
- **Applicability:** Where can you elide? Is there a heads-up?

--
- **Power:** How much can it change behavior?

--
- **Context-dependence:** How much context do you need?


The larger on one axis, the smaller the others must be.

---

# The `?` sugar

```rust
fn process_data() -> Result<u32, Error> {
  let data = read_data()?;
  process(data)
}
```

- Applicability: Small, you have a heads-up
- Power: High, it can radically change control-flow (return)
- Context-dependence: Medium, have to consult return type

---

# Type inference

```rust
fn squares(data: impl Iterator<Item = u32>) -> Vec<u32> {
  data.map(|element| element*2).collect()
}
```

- Applicability: Medium -- always intrafunction.
- Power: High, it can radically change control-flow (return)
- Context-dependence: Varies -- mostly intrafunction, but signatures matter

But compare to global inference like in ML.

---

# TIL: Fundamental tradeoffs are often anything but

.center[.p80[![dogs wrestling over ball](content/images/dogs-wrestling-over-ball.gif)]]

---

# Example: Error handling

- Error codes:
    - easy to forget, obscures the happy path
    - but you can see errors and reason about what will happen
- Exceptions:
    - can't forget, happy path is clear
    - but hard to tell which errors can occur and where
- Compromise:
    - in Rust, the `?` operator
    - in Swift, the `try` keyword

---

# Example: Zero-cost abstractions

- Two objectives in tension:
    - high-level code
    - high-performance code
- Zero-cost abstractions:
    - set of techniques to resolve those tensions

---

# No free lunch

- Consider Rust's borrow checker:
    - you can have threads and shared memory
    - without data-races
- Too good to be true?

---

# Technique: Map the space

- Nothing magic:
    - when you find tension, dig into it
    - identify your requirements firmly
- Often:
    - some requirement can be refined
- But this takes time

---

# Sometimes the resolution is not in the language

- Alternatives:
    - conventions
    - lints
    - documentation or good error messages

---

# TIL: Pluralism

One of the most momentous things to happen to Rust?
